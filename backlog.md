# Backlog

## Tasks to be completed

### 1. Fine-tune threads per block GPU
- Adjust GPU thread configurations for optimized performance in parallel computing tasks.
- Investigate the best thread-per-block configuration for varying workloads.

### 2. Autoset MPI, GPU
- Implement automatic detection and configuration of MPI (Message Passing Interface), and GPU usage based on system capabilities.
- Ensure compatibility with different computing environments.

### 5. Support for 128-bit data in importing raw data
- Extend the raw data import functionality to support 128-bit data types.
- Ensure proper handling and conversion of 128-bit data during the import process.

### 7. Add documentation for dependencies
- Create a section in the documentation listing all project dependencies.
- Include installation instructions and version specifications for each dependency.

### 8. Develop README.md

### 9. Activate GPU in voxel_image modulus
- math
- sphere pack

### 10. VoxelImage operators
- Implement +, +=, -, -=, etc
---

### Orthogonal slices:
