## Tasks to be completed

- Fine-tune threads per block GPU
  - Adjust GPU thread configurations for optimized performance in parallel computing tasks.
  - Investigate the best thread-per-block configuration for varying workloads.
  - Check for NumbaPerformanceWarning

- Support for 128-bit data in importing raw data
  - Extend the raw data import functionality to support 128-bit data types.
  - Ensure proper handling and conversion of 128-bit data during the import process.

- Add documentation for dependencies
  - Create a section in the documentation listing all project dependencies.

- VoxelImage
  - Implement other in place operators -=, *=, etc
  - Guarantee segmentation and masks with different chunk size when store is not in local file system.
  - Deprecate from_array: Put data in VoxelImage create
  - Export raw complex data into real and imaginary
  - Make copy function changes to fast chunk by chunk method if same chunk shape
  - implement hash

- Orthogonal slices:
  - Add scalebar
  - Add calibrationbar
  - Add contour lines to scalar fields
  - Add chunk limit lines
  - Add "over black", "over white" options for segmentation colors
  - Histogram legend with segmentation name instead of phase number
  - Enforce 3D images
  - Generalize allowed colormaps
  - Allow ref_voxel as center of referenced block (chunk)
  - Choose which phases to be shown in histogram
  - Check and raise ValueError if complex dtype
  - Expand to multi-energy CT
  - Expand to vector fields

- Histogram
  - Add histogram documentation to sphinx
  - Change to fast algorithm if equal size bins
  - Put MDF option (maybe discrete=True)

- Dual Energy
  - Implement run(block_id) to check inversion by running only on one chunk.
  - Bug accumulating results on second run
  - Bug freezing with GPU
  - Segmentation and mask should not be hashed
  - Remove collective call in get/set property
  - Put inversion parameters as input parameters or dictionary
  - Check for weird CT MOnte Carlo drawings

- Zarr
  - Test block indexing for 'F' or 'C'
  - put dimension_names in voxel image

> Note: These tasks are subject to change based on project needs and priorities.
