**RockVerse** is designed to be an advanced and comprehensive open Python library
to support computational petrophysics workflows with high-performance computing
capabilities. Built to handle complex, data-intensive tasks, it is tailored
for researchers and professionals in the fields of digital rock petrophysics,
formation evaluation, well logging, and laboratory data analysis.


Key Features
------------

- **Digital Rock Petrophysics (DRP)**:
  Analyze high-resolution digital rock images efficiently, even when dealing with
  files that exceed available computing memory. RockVerse leverages advanced computational
  techniques to handle massive datasets with ease.

- **High-Performance Parallel Computing**:
  Designed for deployment in high-performance computing (HPC) environments, RockVerse utilizes
  message passing interface (MPI) parallel processing to support distributed computations on
  cluster computers. It is optimized for both CPU and GPU architectures, enabling scalable
  performance across diverse systems.

- **Well Logging and Laboratory Data**:
  Streamline the analysis and processing of well log and laboratory data.
