    "Part 3 - Running the Simulation\n",
    "===============================\n",
    "\n",
    "We have completed all the necessary steps to run the Monte Carlo simulations:\n",
    "- Created the `DualEnergyCTGroup` (the variable `dectgroup`).\n",
    "- Imported the original CT scans for low and high energies.\n",
    "- Created a segmentation voxel image (optional, to use calibration materials as a quality control; could also be imported from elsewhere).\n",
    "- Created a mask voxel image (optional, to tell RockVerse which voxels to ignore in the Monte Carlo inversion; could also be imported from elsewhere).\n",
    "- Populated necessary information for the calibration materials.\n",
    "- Pre-calculated the set of inversion coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now call the `run` method to perform the full inversion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: we are performing Monte Carlo in the Digital Rock universe! This process is computationally intensive and is designed to be run in a high-performance computing environment, such as a GPU-enabled machine or a handful of nodes in a CPU cluster. This ensures efficiency and accuracy in processing large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running in Command Line Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "To run in command line mode, save a file, say `run.py`, with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import rockverse as rv\n",
    "dectgroup = rv.open(r'/path/to/dual_energy_ct/C04B21')\n",
    "dectgroup.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and call Python with your MPI executable to run the file, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mpirun -N 256 python run.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or submit it as a batch script to your job scheduler, such as Slurm:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "#SBATCH -J awesome_job_name\n",
    "#SBATCH --nodes=2\n",
    "#SBATCH --partition <your_partition>\n",
    "#SBATCH --gres=gpu:16\n",
    "#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=256\n",
    "#SBATCH --output=outputlog\n",
    "#SBATCH --chdir=/path/to/workdir\n",
    "\n",
    "conda activate you_environment_with_rockverse\n",
    "mpirun python3 ./run.py \n",
