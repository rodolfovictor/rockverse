RockVerse: Python tools for Computational Petrophysics
======================================================

RockVerse is an open-source Python library designed to support high-performance
computational petrophysics workflows. It is optimized for large-scale simulations
and memory-intensive data processing. Leveraging state-of-the-art tools, the
library delivers optimized performance across CPU and GPU parallel computing
environments.

This project is under ongoing development as part of a post-doctoral research
initiative, and we welcome contributions, bug reports, and feature suggestions.
